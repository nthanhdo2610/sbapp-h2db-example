<p>H2 is a open source, compact relational database, written in Java language. 
H2 installer has very little capacity of about 8MB.
One of the interesting features of the H2 is that you can create an In-Memory Database instead of being stored in a computer hard drive. 
This makes query speed and manipulation with data very fast. 
However, if you select the "In-Memory Database" feature, data exists only when the application works, when the application is shut down, the data is also deleted from the memory.
The H2 provides you with an administration tool called H2 Console, and you work with it through  browser.
